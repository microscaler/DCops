# Rust Builder Base Image
# Contains all build dependencies for compiling Rust projects
# This base image is built once and published to ghcr.io/microscaler/dcops-rust-builder-base-image
# The controller production Dockerfiles then use this for the builder stage

# pkg-config: Required for finding system libraries

# Dependencies are downloaded to ~/.cargo/registry and ~/.cargo/git, which persist in the image
